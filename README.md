## Baisic Programming Concepts

Functional programming originates from Alonzo Church's
lambda-calculus, which is a computational model based on
the notion of substitution. Church's lambda-calculus is
often referred to as pure lambda-calculus.

A (functional) program is a lambda-expression (in some extended
lambda-calculus), and computation is defined as a process that turns a
program into a value, which is an expression of some special forms.

### Integers
  
Integers are a special form of values. We have integers like
0,1,-1,2,-2, etc.  We use `int` as the type for integers. Sometime,
we use `sint` for `int` to emphasize that the integers are signed.

### Booleans

There are two boolean values: true and false. The type for these two
values is `bool`.

### Characters

Characters are essentially small integers.
For instance, the character `'a'` refers to its ascii code 97.
The type for characters is `char`.

### Strings

A string is a sequence of characters. The type for strings is `string` or
`strn` (as a shorthand).
